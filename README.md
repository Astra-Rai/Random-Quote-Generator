**Project Summary**


5 Quotes by [Dr. Maya Angelou](https://www.mayaangelou.com/) are stored in an array called, quotesArray. A quote is randomly displayed by user clicking on the button that reads "display next quote."  The button element has the id = "quoteButton"; the EventTarget method addEventListener() is linked using the id of the button element and calls the function displayQuote(). The displayQuote() function generates a random number that reflects the index in quotesArray. A random number between 0 and less than one, a floating-point number, is generated using the Math.random function. This floating-point number is then multiplied by the length of the array, which is obtained using the array.length property and then rounded using the Math.floor function. The quote is displayed as innerHTML of the h3 element with an id= "quoteDisplay" because it is set to the content of quoteArray element using bracket notation.
